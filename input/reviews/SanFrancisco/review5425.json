My criticism would be that the building has a smell.  It's like old wood mixed with food.  That probably sounds stupid but it was a very strong smell. So strong that I was worried about my clothes smelling when we left.  They did not, by the way.  It was fine, but The staff should probably consider opening windows on the upper floor or investing in some air fresheners.  Also, if you need something, the front desk does not answer the phone.  You need to go downstairs and speak directly to them.  It was not a big deal at all since we were always coming and going so we just spoke to them as we passed by, when we were in need of information or extra blankets.
